# Project First Phase Tasks

Based on the "Multi-Agent Red Teaming Survey: Architecture Topologies & Evaluation Framework" document, the following tasks are identified for the first phase of the project.

## Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)

- **Install AutoGen and dependencies:** Set up the necessary software environment by installing the AutoGen library and any other required packages.
- **Set up API access for target models:** Obtain and configure API keys for the target language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Llama-3) that will be used for testing.
- **Download benchmark datasets:** Acquire the standardized benchmark datasets that will be used to evaluate the multi-agent architectures.
- **Configure logging infrastructure:** Establish a system for logging and monitoring experiments, including agent communications, errors, and performance metrics.
- **Set up version control repository:** Initialize a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes to the codebase and other project files.
- **Create project directory structure:** Organize the project files and folders into a logical and consistent structure.
- **Document environment configuration:** Create documentation detailing the software versions, hardware specifications, and other relevant information about the experimental environment.
